# Portfolio
I have created my portfolio website Using Svelte . This website is not like your ordinary portfolio website but has a User Interface like a Desktop . It makes the users feel as if they are surfing through a desktop and can open folders to read the respective information available .
=======
# ⚡️SvelteKit-Portfolio⚡️

## A personal portfolio website made using `@sveltejs/kit`.
The user can surf through this website as if its a Desktop . There are four folders and a NavBar below. The four folders Home, Projects, About and Experiences and Detailed information about me . The NavBar has icons and hyperlinks to github and linkedin. 
Recommended : refresh at every page to be updated .
